# artificial-intelligence-project
Repository for artificial intelligence project for respective computer science module. 

Objective:
The objective of this project was to create a variety of machine learning and classification algorithms and techniques for a 
given dataset of images. The dataset consisted of 8 types of images, split into a living and non-living dataset with image
types: cherry, banana, pear, flower as living and envelope, pencil, golfclub, wineglasss as non-living. All of these images 
were made up of a simple 50x50 black and white image array with the object in the image made up of black pixels with the rest
as white pixels. The first part of this project involved creating 20 images for each type myself with a total of 160 images to
use for classification and feature extraction. The second part of the project involved a total of 4000 training images from 
the image types in the aim of training machine learning models. Ultiamtely, the aim of the feature extraction and model
training was to be able to successfully classify new images tas the correct type hat were input into the models. 

Languages Used:
In this project I mainly used R but for the intial image manipulation and creation I used Python. To intially create the 
dataset I had to convert the raw images of the objects into matrices and dataframes which I used the Python Pandas framework
for. The remainder of the project inclduing feature engineering, statistic analysis, machine learning modelling and 
classification was all done in R. 

Models Used:
I created a
